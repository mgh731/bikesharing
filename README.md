# Bike Sharing NYC 

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to identify trends and interesting points that could be used to decide the details around other bike sharing set ups in different cities. The analysis was done using data from NYC's Citibike bike sharing program. 

## Results

The results displayed clear trends in the day of the week and the time of day that shared bikes were typically used. 

For instance, overall Citibikes were use between 4-7PM which aligns with the afternoon commute home. It should be noted that NYC has another means of transportation like buses and subways which are likely used in the morning commute.

Within that time period the trips averaged about 40 minutes indicating that, on bike, a majority of destintions were at most 40 minutes away from the starting points.

In looking into gender as a parameter for the data, we did not see a large difference in the usage trend (weekdays & evening commute). However there is a significant higher number of men that utilize these bikes than women or unknown. It would be a good idea to compare this usage with overall bike usage between men and women to validate if this follows the same trend. Typically the rides took place on Mondays, Tuesday, and Thursdays. Out of all the days Wednesdays were the least likely to see people using the Citibikes any time of the day.

In looking at the difference between subscribers and customers, Saturdays were more popular days for customers and least popular days for subscribers. This was a similar trend between Female and Male.

This data also showed a clear validation about where trips started, appearing mostly Lower Manhattan through Midtown, indicating that most trips beginning in Manhattan could be commuters to the city.

## Summary
Would recommend using this data to target and test the weekday commutes of any city to begin. The high activity of people during these times, across both genders indicates that the usage of these bikes are for afternoon commutes as opposed to the morning commute or weekend activity. Other data points to consider would be Availability of Bikes in a singular regions by Number of Trip Starts in that region to determine if an influx of bikes promotes usage.
